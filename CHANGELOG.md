## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Core Framework
- Artifact system with Pydantic validation for reproducible pipelines
- Support for artifact lineage tracking and metadata
- Scale factors (tiny/small/medium/full) for fast iteration
- Unix piping support between pipeline steps
- Atomic file writes for artifact metadata
- WandbTracker for optional W&B integration
- CLI generation with tyro

#### Training Recipe Structure
- Recipe package structure at `src/nemotron/recipes/`
- Placeholder structure for Nemotron Nano 2 recipe:
  - Stage 0: Pretraining
  - Stage 1: Instruction Tuning
  - Stage 2: Alignment
- Placeholder structure for ChipNeMo/ScaleRTL recipe:
  - Stage 0: Domain Pretraining
  - Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning
  - Stage 2: Reasoning Enhancement

#### Examples
- Training pipeline pattern examples in `examples/training/`:
  - `hello.py` - Minimal pipeline step example
  - `tutorial_data_prep.py` - Data preparation patterns
  - `tutorial_training.py` - Training loop patterns
  - `tutorial_evaluation.py` - Evaluation patterns

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with:
  - NVIDIA AI stack integration details (Curator, Megatron-Bridge, Automodel, NeMo-RL, Evaluator)
  - Recipe overview with paper links
  - Usage examples and quick start
- Training recipe documentation:
  - `docs/training/run-recipe.md` - Guide for running recipes
  - `docs/training/add-recipe.md` - Guide for contributing recipes
