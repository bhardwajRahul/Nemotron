## What is Nemotron?

[NVIDIA Nemotron™](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemotron) is a family of open, high-efficiency models with fully transparent training data, weights, and recipes.

Nemotron models are designed for **agentic AI workflows** — they excel at coding, math, scientific reasoning, tool calling, instruction following, and visual reasoning (for the VL models).

They are optimized for deployment across a spectrum of compute tiers (edge, single GPU, data center) and support frameworks like NeMo and TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and SGLang, with NIM microservice options for scalable serving.

## Nemotron Use Case Examples

Below is an outline of the end-to-end use case examples provided in the [`use-case-examples`](./use-case-examples/) directory. These scenarios demonstrate practical applications that go beyond basic model inference.

### What You'll Find

- **Agentic Workflows**  
  Orchestration of multi-step AI agents, integrating planning, context management, and external tools/APIs.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems**  
  Building pipelines that combine retrieval components (vector databases, search APIs) with Nemotron models for grounded, accurate outputs.

- **Integration with External Tools & APIs**  
  Examples of Nemotron models powering applications with structured tool calling, function execution, or data enrichment.

- **Production-Ready Application Patterns**  
  Architectures supporting scalability, monitoring, data pipelines, and real-world deployment considerations.

> See the [`use-case-examples/`](./use-case-examples/) subfolders for in-depth, runnable examples illustrating these concepts.
